🔎 Wireshark Traffic Analysis Lab
📌 Overview

This lab demonstrates packet capture and traffic analysis using Wireshark. The objective was to analyze DNS queries, HTTPS encrypted traffic, and DNS error responses.

🛠 Tools Used

- Wireshark
- Kali Linux
- Google Slides (Documentation)

🔍 Analysis Breakdown
1️⃣ DNS Resolution

Observed DNS queries to resolve external domains

- Internal Host: 10.0.2.5
- DNS Server: 172.20.10.1
- Protocol: UDP Port 53

2️⃣ HTTPS Encrypted Traffic

- Identified TLS 1.3 encrypted application data
- Observed QUIC handshake
- TCP communication over port 443

3️⃣ DNS Error Detection

- Applied filter: dns.flags.rcode != 0
- Detected NXDOMAIN responses ("No such name")
- Demonstrated DNS failure analysis capability

🛡️ Security Insight

Monitoring DNS failures and encrypted outbound traffic is essential in detecting suspicious activity such as domain generation algorithms (DGA) or abnormal network behavior.
